# Someone's Treasure üêÄüßÄ

## Introduction

This is an orthogonal game made entirely in Python using Pygame. It was inspired by several games, like **The Legend of Zelda**, **Titan Souls**, **Binding of Isaac**, _etc_.

My idea is to make a maze game with a few levels, a basic collecting system, a few puzzles, some enemies and a boss battle.

## Technologies

The code was made entirely in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). I also used [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for some lesser functionalities.

Maps were created in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and the sprites were either created with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) or downloaded from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/), in the case of the [dungeon tileset](https://opengameart.org/content/dungeon-tileset-4) used.

Music and sound effects were all downloaded from [freesound](https://freesound.org/) under a Creative Commons 0 license.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to [Clear Code](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCznj32AM2r98hZfTxrRo9bQ), an amazing YouTube channel with many coding tutorials in Python. I used some of his videos below as inspiration to develop this project:

- [Creating a Zelda style game in Python [with some Dark Souls elements]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw)
- [The ultimate introduction to Pygame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk)
- [Creating a Mario style level in Python / Pygame with a visual level editor [Tiled]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJMDh9QGRgs).

Also thanks to [Rabbid76](https://github.com/Rabbid76) for its [PyGameExamplesAndAnswers](https://github.com/Rabbid76/PyGameExamplesAndAnswers) repository. It definetely helped me alot.

Last but not least, thanks to my bf for helping me with sprites. üíô
