# Someone's Treasure üêÄ

## Introduction

This is an orthogonal game made entirely in Python using Pygame. It was inspired by games like The Legend of Zelda and Titan Souls.

## Installation

Download the project folder (`.zip`), extract it and run `someones-treasure.exe`.

## Technologies

The code was made entirely in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). I also used [numpy](https://numpy.org/) for some lesser functionalities.

Maps were created in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and the sprites were either created with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) or downloaded from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/). See credits in the [`assets/`](assets/) folder.
