# Someone's Treasure üêÄ

## Introduction

This is an orthogonal game made entirely in Python using Pygame. It was inspired by games like The Legend of Zelda and Titan Souls.

My idea is to make a labyrinth game with a few levels, a basic crafting system, a few enemies and a boss.

## Technologies

The code was made entirely in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). I also used [numpy](https://numpy.org/) for some lesser functionalities.

Maps were created in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and the sprites were either created with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) or downloaded from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/). See credits in the [`assets/`](assets/) folder.

## Download & Installation

SOON

## Manual Installation

1. Download [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the project folder (`.zip`) and extract it somewhere.
3. In the console, open the game directory and type `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, then press ENTER;
4. Still at the console, type `python main.py` and press ENTER once again;
5. Have fun!
